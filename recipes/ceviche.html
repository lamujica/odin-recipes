    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ceviche is a refreshing Latin American dish made from raw fish or seafood that's marinated in citrus juice—usually lime or lemon—which “cooks”
      the protein through a chemical process. It is often tossed with chopped onions, cilantro, chili peppers, and sometimes corn or sweet potatoes,
      creating a bright, zesty burst of flavors and textures [Description created by Microsoft Copilot]
