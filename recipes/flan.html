    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 granulated sugar</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 - 14 ounce sweetened condensed milk can</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350F</li>
      <li>
        On medium heat pour sugar onto saucepan. Stir the sugar until it begins to brown and clump together. Keep stirring until caramel consistency
        is reached. Then remove.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour caraml into a 7-inch round pan. Tilt pan around to achieve even coating. If caramel hardens too quickly, carefully reheat pan by placing
        it on stovetop
      </li>
      <li>Once even coat is achieved, place caramel lined pan to the side</li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix your eggs, condensed milk, whole milk and vanilla extract. Whisk until everything is combined. Do not overwhisk - it will
        cause airbubbles.
      </li>
      <li>Pour wet mixture into caramel pan, and then cover with lid or aluminum foil</li>
      <li>Place caramel pan into a deep baking dish. Pour water into baking dish until water reaches halfway up outside the caramel pan</li>
      <li>Place baking dish containing the flan pan into the oven for an hour and 15 minutes</li>
      <li>
        Remove dish from oven. Lift flan pan out of water bath. Remove flan cover and let it rest at room temperature. It may look jiggly but that is
        okay; it will continue to cook
      </li>
      <li>Once cooled, cover again with aluminum and leave in fridge for 4 hours or overnight</li>
      <li>To remove flan from pan, slide knife along the side to loosen it up. Place plate on top of pan and flip carefully. Enjoy!</li>
